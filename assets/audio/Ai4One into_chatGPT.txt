This is the logic for an app called "Ai4One" by Mekel Haunsby it simulates human voice by playing audiofiles

The user adjusts sliders from 1 to 100 for different preferences, divided into 20 different aspects, 20 different tactics, and 10 different mindsets. 

The top five aspects, tactics, and  mindsets are selected. In case of ties, the last value entered takes precedence.


The application generates a "user program" consisting of 50 sets. The sequence of sets alternates between Set 1 and Set 2.

Set Questions
Each program consists of 25 unique Set 1 and Set 2 questions. These questions are created by combining the top five items from the user's aspect and tactic preferences (L1 and L2). The selected aspect (L1) and Tactic (L2) s do not vary within a set. 

Transition questions are used when switching sets.

When a set question is answered with "yes", the app checks for the presence of one of the top five mindsets by random but from the top five ranked using MXX_1 and MXX_2 if answred "yes" an additinal question is asked using the fitting MXX_3 or MXX_4. 


This is the formular

Set 1

S1A+ L1S
If yes then MXX_1 If yes then MXX_2
If No, play one of the "NO" answers (NO1-NO40) and proceed to the next question.

S1B_1+ L2O +S1B_2+L1S
If yes then MXX_1 If yes then MXX_2
If no then random NXX and next question

S1C_1+ L2O+S1C_2+ L1S
If yes then MXX_3 If yes then MXX_4
If no then random NXX

S1D+L1S
If yes then MXX_3 If yes then MXX_4
If no then random NXX

Random transition (NQXX)
Set 2
S2A+L2O
If yes then MXX_1 If yes then MXX_2

S2B_1+ L1S+S2b_2+ L2O
If yes then MXX_1 If yes then MXX_2

S2C_1+L1S+SC2_2+L2O
If yes then MXX_3 If yes then MXX_4

S2D_1+L2O+S2D_2
If yes then MXX_3 If yes then MXX_4

Random transition (NQXX)
